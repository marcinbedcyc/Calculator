# Calculator
Basic calculator created for programming lessons on studies.</br>
Technologies used in project:

The application is fully resizable thanks bindings for example font size and buttons size are always fit to window.</br>
There are used simple ScriptEngine to evaluate expression given by user.</br>
Key's events are also implemented to make application more friendly to user:
- 0...9 key is equivalent Zero...Nine Button
- +, -, /, * key is equivalent Plus, Minus, Divide, Multiply Button
- enter, = key is equivalent Equal Button and it will compute the expression typed by user
- backspace key deletes one char
- Shift + backspace is equivalent C Button and it deletes all textField's content

 Calculator has got a little memory too and there are no equivalent keys to buttons which managment this little memory.
 - M+ adds to memory
 - MR puts memory on TextField
 - MC cleans memory
